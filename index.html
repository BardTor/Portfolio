				<div class="column" id="project_description">
					<p class="about_p">This project brought a closure to my Highger Diploma in Softare Development. By completion of "The Comprehensive 2020 Android Development Masterclass" I gained the skills necessary to develop a fully working android application. The purpose of WITF was to reduce food wasted by Western households. App was able to scan products (via qr barcodes) and add them to SQLite database. On the basis of said database, users would be able to browse recipes on the Heroku JSON server and commit to procuring them (and consequently reducing products available by substracting them from database itself). On top of that app was able to scan recipies qr barcodes, which generated a "shopping list" that user could follow up. By scanning products, the list would become shorter and eventualy completed. At any one time user was able to amend/delete products available at his disposal and save his favourite recipes.</p>
